# EcoTrack


_For a greener future, one step at a time_

A Trash Tracker app that promotes Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) #11 - Sustainable Cities and Communities. This app could encourage users to take photos of litter or trash in their communities, tag the location, and report it.



## Features

- **Profile Types**: A user can either login as a Regular User or a Social Worker. Each type of user has a specific responsibility. The Regular User is responsible to report the trashs around them. The Social Worker is resposible to navigate to the scene of the trash and clean it up.

- **Photo Upload**: Users can capture photos of littered areas using their phone's camera within the app, or upload an image from their Gallery.

- **Location Tagging**: The app automatically tags the location of the photo using GPS coordinates. The users also have the option of tagging the location manually.

- **Report Submission**: Users can submit the report with a brief description of the issue, along with the trash size, type and an image of the scene.

- **Green Points** - Incentive for users to keep their community clean. The Regular Users get a certain amount of Green Points based on the trash that they reported. For the Social Workers, it is the trashs that they have cleaned that will fetch them their Green Points.

- **Leaderboard**: Gamify the process by creating a leaderboard that showcases users with the most Green Points and ranks them accordingly.

- **News Feed**: Each user type will get a tailored selection of news feed on the app's home screen once they log in.
